# Brunch in LA

## Introduction

This is an attempt to make my stack with [https://angularjs.org/ AngularJS]
using the [http://brunch.io/ Brunch] as a build tool and [http://livescript.net/
LiveScript] and [http://jade-lang.com/ Jade] as compile-to/templating languages.

The setup has an existing client-side implementation of the authentication
engine.

## References

This project/brunch is based on a lot of projects. A lot of tips and techniques
have been inspired by the works of others. Following are a few of the many
references I used for making this.
